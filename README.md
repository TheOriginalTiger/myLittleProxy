# myLittleProxy
A tiny proxy server working with HTTP GET requests which is made as a final project in NSU's course of declarative programming

TODO:
1. Now the proxy is only capable of receiving data. Need write a decent forwarding and responding mechanism 
2. It is absolutly useless as long as it is working in single thread. Multithreading feature will obviously solve it
3. Cashing data isn't good in terms of ethics but as long as it is a pet-project implementing it will give some really useful experience
